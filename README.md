# MCP Inspector

Server-agnostic MCP demo client for the talk "MCP from Concept to Demo: An Open
Data Example with DKAN" (Drupal AI Learners Club, Aug 21, 2026). Teaches MCP's
three primitives by making the control distinction visible: tools are
model-controlled, prompts are user-controlled, resources are app-controlled.

Plan and architecture: [mcp-inspector-handoff-plan.md](mcp-inspector-handoff-plan.md).

## How it works

- The append-only **event log is the single source of truth** — timeline,
  replay, capability diff, and the raw-frames drawer are pure renderings of it.
  Live and replay share one renderer. Schema: `src/lib/events.ts` (zod).
- **Server-side proxy** (`/api/mcp`): mints OAuth `client_credentials` tokens
  per persona (re-mint before the 300s expiry), forwards JSON-RPC, parses SSE.
  Secrets and tokens never reach the browser; logs are redacted at write time.
- **Agent loop** (`src/lib/agent.ts`) runs client-side so every hop lands in
  the log; `/api/agent` only holds the Anthropic key.

## Setup

Requires a running DKAN site with `dkan_mcp_server` + the simple_oauth stack
and two `client_credentials` consumers (see the plan's provisioning checklist).

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in consumer secrets + Anthropic key
npm run dev
```

`.env.local` keys: `DKAN_MCP_URL`, `DKAN_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL`,
`DKAN_ALLOW_SELF_SIGNED`, `PERSONA_{READONLY,EDITOR}_CLIENT_{ID,SECRET}` +
`_SCOPE`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, optional `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`.

## Using it

- **Live**: pick a persona, Connect. Click a tool in the left rail for a
  schema-generated form; click a resource to Preview (read without attaching)
  and Attach to context. The chat bar drives agent mode ("step between hops"
  gates each hop); model responses render as markdown. Prompts are slash
  commands in the chat bar: `/expl` → Tab completes, type args inline (value
  typeahead via MCP completion/complete, Tab accepts), first Enter expands &
  previews, second Enter sends (Esc cancels). Switching personas appends to
  the same log — that powers the capability diff. `▶ Replay recording` /
  `⬇ Save .json` on the timeline.
- **Replay**: recording picker + play/step controls. The golden demo recording
  (`src/lib/fixtures/goldens/full-demo.json`) auto-pauses at narration cards.
- **`{ } Raw frames`**: JSON-RPC exchanges paired by request id, hidden from
  the main timeline.
- **Learning aids**: a collapsible legend in the rail (primitives + who
  controls each, actor badges); every timeline card has an "ⓘ what is this?"
  note linking into the MCP spec (works in replay too); tool-result cards tab
  between text content, `structuredContent`, the tool's `outputSchema`, and
  the raw result.
- **`⊞ Context`**: the exact payload the next model call will send, read live
  from the agent loop — system prompt (attached data visually delimited),
  full conversation array, tool definitions, ~token estimates. Editable:
  system instructions, per-resource detach, host-side tool toggles (hides
  tools from the model only), clear conversation. Every edit is logged
  (`context.updated` / `resource.detached` events).

Keyboard: `p` presentation mode (130% scale, hidden chrome), `Esc` exit,
`space` play/pause, `←/→` step, `Home`/`End` jump, `/` prompt commands.

## Scripts

```bash
npm test                                      # vitest unit tests (lib core)
npm run typecheck
npm run validate:fixture                      # zod-validate the authored fixture
npx tsx scripts/annotate-golden.ts <log.json> # recorded session → annotated golden
```
